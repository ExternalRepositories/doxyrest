Bundled Frameworks
==================

Items in this category are bundled in the recommended ``doxyrest_b`` bundle package. Therefore, if you build Doxyrest from ``doxyrest_b`` package, you can safely skip the current section -- all the following dependencies are already included and will be built automatically during the build process.

However, if you use the standalone ``doxyrest`` package, you will need to download and build these dependencies first.

* AXL

	Doxyrest uses AXL as a general purpose C++ support library.

	AXL is a lightweight C++ library featuring:

	- Java naming convention;
	- non-zero-terminated UTF-8 string slices as a default string-passing model;
	- TLS-based error-handling system;
	- unified reference-counting model;
	- wrappers for many popular libraries;
	- and more...

	Sources of AXL are available at: http://tibbo.com/downloads/archive/axl
