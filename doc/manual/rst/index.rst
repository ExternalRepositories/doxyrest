Doxyrest Manual
===============

Abstract
--------

Doxyrest is a compiler from **Doxygen** XML to **reStructuredText** -- hence, the name. It parses XML database generated by `Doxygen <http://www.stack.nl/~dimitri/doxygen/>`_, feeds it to Lua-based **string template engine** and produces reStructuredText suitable for being passed further on to Python documentation generator `Sphinx <http://www.sphinx-doc.org>`_.

The main purpose of Doxyrest is to generate **beautiful** Sphinx-based documentation for **C/C++** APIs. But not just that!

Doxygen can be replaced with your own source-code-analyzing tool capable of producing Doxygen-compatible XML database. Lua frames used for generation of reStructuredText can also be replaced with your own ones. It means that both the input and the output of Doxyrest are **100% customizable** -- and without re-compilation!

To rephrase, Doxyrest could be used to produce customizable documentation/stats/reports for APIs written in **any programming language**!

Motivation
----------

In the year 2016 the only option fellow C/C++ programmers have when it comes to documenting C/C++ APIs, is, sadly enough, Doxygen.

Don't get me wrong. Doxygen was **revolutional** when if first emerged, and it quickly became a **de-facto standard** of documenting C/C++ code. But unfortunately, it has two major problems:

1. The default Doxygen output is... **not** exactly **good-looking**, to say the least.

	Some people may not be as picky as I am, but I believe no professional web designer would ever use words "Doxygen" and "beautiful" in the same sentence. But you know what, it would be alright -- should Doxygen provide a way to tweak its output! Which leads us to a larger problem...

2. Doxygen never really developed sufficient **customizability**.

	Too much is **hard-coded** into the **monolithic** C++ core of Doxygen. That applies to both the back-end (generation of HTML and PDF) and to the front end (source code parser).

I was contemplating the idea of creating a better alternative for documenting C/C++ for many years already. But the actual decision to finally get down to it came with the need to document `Jancy <http://tibbo.com/jancy>`_ API for `IO Ninja <http://tibbo.com/ninja>`_ (a universal all-in-one low-level IO debugger).

Jancy is a C-family scripting language, but its keyword set and new syntax constructs make it impossible to be used with Doxygen out-of-the-box. Should Doxygen provide front-end modularity, I may have silenced my inner designer-wannabe and accepted whatever default output Doxygen spits out. Alas, with Doxygen you can't add a new parser without the need to merge it into the Doxygen core and re-compile Doxygen.

So, I finally decided to fix the problem **once and for all** -- and **Doxyrest** was born!
